Snakebite  Detection & Identification   With Snakebite Mark Using Machine Learning Approach


Snakebite envenoming is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by toxins in
the bite of a venomous snake. We estimate that India had 1.2 million snakebite
deaths (average 58,000/year) from 2000 to 2019.Most of them are due to a lack of
medical care and non-recognition of the bitten snake. Such a situation is where
our idea comes into play. We aim to develop a system that utilizes modern
technology like image processing and artificial intelligence to identify the
snake.We capture the bitten area and process the image using our database. As a
result, the database identifies the snake comparing the previously trained data
with the new one.The identification of the snake is of utmost importance in
planning treatment for the snakebite envenoming. But it is not always possible.
Ideally, the dead snake would be brought in with the person, but in areas where
snake bite is more common, local knowledge may be sufficient to recognize the
snake. However, in an urban area, it is more difficult to identify the snake.If not
treated immediately they may die from respiratory failure. Venom emitted from
some types of cobras, almost all vipers and some sea snakes cause necrosis of
muscle tissue. Muscle tissue will begin to die throughout the body, a condition
known as rhabdomyolysis.Because of this fact, only trained medical professionals
should give antivenom to patients. This system helps the medical professionals to
identify the snake properly and helps them if there is no other option.
